# shadcn-meteor

shadcn-meteor is an unofficial community-led [Meteor.js](https://meteor.com) port of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

> **Note** <br> **We are not affiliated with shadcn and this project is not ready yet.**
> Today, it is possible to use shadcn/ui with Meteor, but some adjustments are needed, like removing `use-client` and adapting navigation. The goal of this project is to make it work out of the box with React and Meteor.js. 

Accessible and customizable components that you can copy and paste into your apps. Free. Open Source. **Use this to build your own component library**.
